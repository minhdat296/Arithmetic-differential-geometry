\section{D-modules for schemes of positive characteristics}
    \begin{convention} \label{conv: arithmetic_D_modules_for_schemes_over_perfect_fields_general_conventions}
        Henceforth, we fix a \textit{complete} non-archimedean field $(K, |-|)$ of \textit{mixed characteristic} $(0, p)$ (for some prime $p$) and its valuation ring $K^{\circ} := \{x \in K \mid |x| \leq 1\}$ shall be assumed to be \textit{discretely valued} (i.e. $K^{\circ}$ is a Noetherian local domain that is not a field, whose unique maximal ideal - which we shall denote by $\m_K$ - is principal). Its residue field shall be denoted by $k := K^{\circ}/\m_K$, where $\m_K := \{x \in K \mid |x| < 1\}$ is the unique maximal ideal of $K^{\circ}$. In addition, let us fix a pseudo-uniformiser $\varpi \in \m_K$, and recall that because $K^{\circ}$ is discretely valued, the maximal ideal $\m_K$ is principal: in particular, $\m_K = (\varpi)$.
